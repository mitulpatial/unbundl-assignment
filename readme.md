# unbundle assignment

## assignment 1: Create a Product carousel for featured products

### my approach

Languages used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
  Framework used: Bootstrap (for CSS)

### reason behind my approach

## According to the assignment requirement Bootstrap is easy to use for CSS. To make CSS for carousel section can take long time and also long length of CSS to define the feature. This lead to me use CSS framework.

## assignment 2: Develop a Customizable Product Bundle for Chocolate brand

### my approach

Languages used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### reason behind my approach

As the requirements in the Job Description specified the requirement of basic languages, I chose to go by the basic develpment (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I chose not to go with React for the development because with the basic languages I can showcase my skill and the knowledge building basics of web development.
As the reference for assignment was a broken link, I was unable to check the reference for customized product bundle, so I designed the section by myself
